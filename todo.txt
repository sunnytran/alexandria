front
nsted reply bug cant find redux function
image upload
knex[0] in server.js seems a little hacky, find a better alternative
pass id through router and into database, not the name
TODO: check if fields are empty before submitting
remove hook dependency warnings or at least fix them
check into useffect lag when switching pages
sort posts newest first? or maybe a "relevance"?
organize reply into "reply component" with logic which contains "reply cards"
paginate
cache hiding
save nested hides when hiding its parent

redux
hate having to create more and more classes just or specific state variables
right now i can't set a variable without appending it to a list

server
organize express routes

db
add a table of comments for every post and a table of posts for every board
timezone && then time for the front (date include actual time)

FIXED
format the timestamp
  // TODO: Nesting
  // TODO: Close Reply Form by setting it to null
addposts redux upate the state, don't return the payload
posting bug posts.map is not a function
redux constant rendering is this normal?
    - i keep getting insufficientresources
